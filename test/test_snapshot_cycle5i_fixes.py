"""A snapshot this tool cannot restore is not a success, and must not prune what can be.

The archive bound was applied to upload, to a fetched bundle, and to a local restore --
three of the four paths that read an archive. Creation was the fourth, and it is the worst
one to miss: `snapshot` reported success AND pruned older bundles, so a workspace past the
bound traded restorable backups for one that never restores.
