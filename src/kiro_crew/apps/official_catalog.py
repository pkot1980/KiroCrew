"""Fetch the official app catalog and annotate registry rows with it.

WHAT THIS IS. The catalog at ``apps.crew.kiro.dev`` is the list Kiro Crew
publishes, delivered as a document rather than baked into the wheel. The bundled
``app-registry.json`` answers the same question offline -- it is the seed -- so
both carry ``provenance: "official"``; see ``_apply_trust_fields``.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, YET. Three deliberate omissions, each a fail-closed gate here
rather than an ignored field, so the first time one matters it surfaces loudly
instead of degrading silently:

- **No signature verification.** The catalog is KMS-signed and a ``.sig`` sidecar
  is published beside it, but nothing here checks it. Trust is therefore TLS to
  our own domain -- the same basis on which the installer already fetches the
  CLI wheel, not a new low, but strictly less than the signature would give. The
  consequence is enforced below: a curated author does NOT mint the verified
  mark while this is true.
- **No tombstone resolution.** ``removed`` / ``reinstated`` carry withdrawal
  history with date precedence and a fail-closed tie rule. Implementing half of
  that would be worse than not implementing it, so a document carrying either
  list non-empty is REFUSED outright and the client falls back to the seed. A
  withdrawn app must never be rendered because we skipped the mechanism that
  withdraws it.
- **No new inventory.** Every entry annotates a row that already exists (a
  built-in discovered from disk, or a seed-index row). A published ``git`` source
  is pinned to a COMMIT, and the install path clones with ``--branch``, which a
  commit id is not -- so adding installable entries needs that path changed
  first. An entry matching nothing is ignored.
